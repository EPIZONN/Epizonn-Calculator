# Epizónn Calculator

This calculator is our final project in our Object Oriented Programming course.


## ☞𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗰𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿

In this calculator, we used frame for making the screen, labels for putting digit buttons and another labels for function keys. A size of 300×400, with a title Epizónn Calculator that will appear above the display.


## ☞𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗻𝘀

At first, the buttons appears but was not fuctionable. But by using partial from functools as another import the buttons in the calculator works. Also, the color of the calculator gives emphasis to its functions ( gray for numbers and decimal point, black for mathematical operations, red for equals, and yellow for both delete and clear all).
